				  </div>
					<aside class="notes">
						This makes James a bit stressed and frustrated.   But, being the good developer he is, he analyzes the problem, and breaks it down, starting with his questions...
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>James has these questions:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>How would you integrate D3 into a React app?</li>
						<li>Don't they both manipulate the DOM?<br>How can I make sure they don't step on each other?</li>
						<li>Where do I draw the line between what React handles<br>and what D3 handles?</li>
						<li>What are the advantages to using these libraries together?</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						having asked himself these questions, James decides to start by reviewing his current app, and how it can lend itself to adding a data visualization
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Step 1: Review your current app</h4>
					<p>James' current app has:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>an App component:<br>the starting place for the app</li>
					<li>an InputForm component:<br>with a form for the user to enter a year</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>step 1 code: <a href="http://bit.ly/2mZlU77">http://bit.ly/2mZlU77</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						this app has the start of what he needs.  The app has an input form, where the user can enter a year for the sales data he wants to see.  That should help him when he starts adding in the data viz code...
						Let's look at his base react components and app... (switch to code editor and app)
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Step 2: Get/Find a Standalone D3 Data Visualization</h4>
					<p>Then James looks around online<br>(of course!)<br>to see if he can find an example of <br>a bar chart created with D3</p>
					<br>
					<p>step 2 code: <a href="http://bit.ly/2ly0OzO">http://bit.ly/2ly0OzO</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						James, like any good developer, hits the servers, and looks around online, to find an example of a D3 bar chart that he can use as an example of the data visualization that he wants in his react app
						Let's look at the example that James found online (switch to code editor and app)
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Step 3: Divide the D3 code into components</h4>
					<p>James looks at the D3 code,<br>and he sees these components:
					<ul>
						<li>The sales data</li>
						<li>An X axis</li>
						<li>A Y axis</li>
						<li>The bar chart</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						James then looks at this D3 code, mentally separating it into components.  This is a "react-y" way of looking at code, and will help James to build the D3 visualization with React components
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>While James works to move these D3 components<br>into his React app, he thinks about:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What should D3 handle?</li>
						<li>What should React handle?</li>
						<li>What type of app data flow should I have?</li>
						<li>How should I break up the data visualization into components?</li>
						<li>How should I encapsulate the components?</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						There are many things to think about when building out the D3 react components, but they are all things you would need to think about when building out any kind of coded components, so, for the most part, this list should look familiar to you
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>James codes up his components<br>for his data visualization,<br>and moves them into his React app:</p><br>
					<ul>
						<li>BarChart component - with a bar sub-component</li>
						<li>ChartAxis component - to use for both X and Y axes</li>
						<li>one month of static data to work with</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>step 3 code: <a href="http://bit.ly/2n8gI03">http://bit.ly/2n8gI03</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's take a look at the components that James came up with... (switch to code editor and app)
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div class="flex-container">
					  <div class="flex-item">
						<img src='images/james-happy.png' height='500'/>
					  </div>
					  <div class="flex-item">
						<p>At this point, James now has a<br>working bar chart in his React app!<br>But, he's not done yet... </p>
					  </div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						James is almost done!  He has a working data visualization, but he is still missing something...
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>step 4: Make it interactive!</h4>
					<p>Since James now has the visualization broken up into<br>React components, this part will be easy! Next he needs to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>add an external sales file that can be swapped easily</li>
						<li>update the code to use a year to get the right sales data to display</li>
						<li>send the new data to the BarChart component</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Because of the work that james already did to put his D3 data visualiztion into react components, adding interactivity is pretty easy...
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Let's take a look at what James has come up with:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>James has added the sales data as an external json file</li>
						<li>In App.jsx: he adds a piece of code to get the correct data<br>from the external file, and sets the salesData</li>
						<li>In BarChart.jsx: he adds a componentWillUpdate, to react to<br>the new sales data coming into the component</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>step 4 code: <a href="http://bit.ly/2mcZbET">http://bit.ly/2mcZbET</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's take a look at what James has done to finish up the app, and make it fully functional (switch to code editor and app)
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>And done!</h4>
					<p>James now has an interactive D3 data visualization<br>in his React app, which:
					<ul>
						<li>allows a user to look at sales data for different years...</li>
						<li>...and uses the same data visualization components</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						James is rather proud of his accomplishment at this point, and feels that this is a good base to be able to extend his app in the future...

					  <div class="flex-item">
						<p>James reflects on all his hard work,<br>thinking about the questions<br>he asked earlier</p>
					  </div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's take a look at what James has learned from this experience...
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><i>1. How would you integrate D3 into a React app?</i></p>
					<ul>
						<li>James started by first reviewing his current React app</li>
						<li>He then found a standalone D3 visualization</li>
						<li>He then create React components from the D3 code</li>
						<li>And, then he made the data visualization interactive,<br>using the best parts of React and D3 together</li>
					</li>
					<aside class="notes">
						
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><i>2. Don't they both manipulate the DOM?<br>How can I make sure they don't step on each other?</i></p>
					<p>Yes, they both manipulate the DOM, but when used together,<br>you should clearly separate who is doing what,<br>according to what each does best.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><i>3. Where do I draw the line between what React handles and what D3 handles?</i></p>
					<p>James finds that with most DOM manipulations,<br>you can let React handle it,<br>like when storing data and passing it to components<br><br>but when it comes to<br>highly complex data viz calculations, leave that to D3</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><i>4. What are the advantages to using both of these libraries together?</i></p>
					<p>As James is working, he finds out what these are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>React is faster with DOM manipulation (using it's virtual DOM)</li>
						<li>React is good at handling page/app state</li>
						<li>D3 does a better job at the heavy calculations<br>that are sometimes required for data visualizations,<br>like calculating the scales for a bar chart</li>
					</ul>
